# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

The naive approach would be to run a loop or recursion n times and du multiplication of x with itself. But what if the number is too big? Say the maximum integer value. Then it is inefficient...

And if we think of the n, actually we can try to represent it as sum of powers of two. It is called a binary exponentiation algorithm. E.g if we want to compute a^13 we can represent 13(1101 in binary)
as 1 + 4 + 8 or 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3. An in order to sum powers we need to multiply the bases, so a^13 = a^8 * a^4 * a^1.

So in other words instead of multiplying always with the same base, we can multiply the base with itself and generate bases powered with power of 2. And this power of two comes from bit representation of the pow n number which is reached as we know by halfing the result.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

Firstly we check the edge cases if the power is 0 or less then 0. In the first case we just return 1 and in the last case we make from x -> 1 / x(remember school math) and make n positive for our convenience. Now we are good to go.

```
func myPow(x float64, n int) float64 {
	if n == 0 {
		return 1
	}
	if n < 0 {
		x , n = 1/x, -n
	}
}
```

I choose a recursive approach so we need a second function which will perform the computation itself

```
func myPowHelper(x float64, n int) float64 {
	
}
```

And now comes the main logic. Let's break down what we want to reach. E.g we want to compute myPow(5,15). As it turned out we can use binary representation of 15 and break down 5^15 into 5^8 * 5^4 * 5^2 * 5*1 what gives us 5^15. But how do we get these 5^8 and 5^4? Simply by multiplying n with itself several times. E.g

```
1) 5^1 = n = 5
2) 5^2 = n * n = n^2 = 5 * 5 = 25
2) 5^4 = n^2 * n^2 = n^4 = 25 * 25 = 625
3) 5^8 = n^4 * n^4 = n^8 = 625 * 625 = 390625
```

You see? Just by multiplying new bases with themselves we get main base(in this case 5) in the power of power of two(4 = 2^2, 8 = 2^3). Quite niceðŸ™‚ 

And now comes the trick.

We keep dividing our n by 2 aka retrieving its binary representation bit by bit and everywhere we the bit has value 1 we return our current x multiplied by myPowHelper with n - 1; and if it is 0 we square the x and half the n.

```
func myPowHelper(x float64, n int) float64 {
	if n == 1 {
		return x
	}
	if n % 2 == 1 {
		return x * myPowHelper(x,n - 1)
	} else {
		return myPowHelper(x * x,n / 2)
	}
}
```

Let's go through recursive calls and you will get it

```
myPowHelper(5,15) -> return 5(5^1) and return myPowHelper(5,14) | here x = 5 
myPowHelper(5,14) -> square x (new x = 25 = 5^2) and return myPowHelper(25,7) | here x = 25 
myPowHelper(25,7) -> return 25(5^2) and call myPowHelper(25,6) | here x = 25
myPowHelper(25,6) -> square x (new x = 625 = 5^4) and return myPowHelper(625,3) | here x = 625
myPowHelper(625,3) -> return 625(5^4) and call myPowHelper(625 ,2) | here x = 625
myPowHelper(625,2) -> square x (new x = 390625= 5^8) and return myPowHelper(390625,1) | here x = 390625
myPowHelper(390625,1) -> return 390625
```

Here are the powers of 5 again and the final expression in the number form

```
1) 5^1 = n = 5
2) 5^2 = n * n = n^2 = 5 * 5 = 25
2) 5^4 = n^2 * n^2 = n^4 = 25 * 25 = 625
3) 5^8 = n^4 * n^4 = n^8 = 625 * 625 = 390625

5^15 = 5^1 * 5^2 * 5^4 * 5*8
```

And finally if you follow the recursive calls where the actual x is returned we come to:

```
return 5 * myPowHelper(25,7) equal to 25 * myPowHelper(625,3) equal to 625 * myPowHelper(390625,1) equal to 390625
```

So we need this n-1 to have space to square the base and we return x by n = 1 so that we end up multiplying the final power of x and do not enter endless recursion.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

O(log n)

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

O(log n) due to call stack space

# Code
```
func myPow(x float64, n int) float64 {
	if n == 0 {
		return 1
	}
	if n < 0 {
		x , n = 1/x, -n
	}
	return myPowHelper(x ,n)
}

func myPowHelper(x float64, n int) float64 {
	if n == 1 {
		return x
	}
	if n % 2 == 1 {
		return x * myPowHelper(x,n - 1)
	} else {
		return myPowHelper(x * x,n / 2)
	}
}
```
